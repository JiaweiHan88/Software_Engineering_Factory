# HEARTBEAT.md — UX Designer Heartbeat Checklist

Run this checklist on every heartbeat.

## 1. Identity and Context

- `GET /api/agents/me` — confirm your id, role, budget, chainOfCommand.
- Check wake context: `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID`, `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON`, `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_COMMENT_ID`.

## 2. Local Planning Check

1. Read today's plan from `$AGENT_HOME/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` under "## Today's Plan".
2. Review each planned item: what's completed, what's blocked, and what's next.
3. For any blockers, escalate to the CEO or resolve them yourself.
4. **Record progress updates** in the daily notes.

## 3. Get Assignments

- `GET /api/companies/{companyId}/issues?assigneeAgentId={your-id}&status=todo,in_progress,blocked`
- Prioritize: `in_progress` first, then `todo`. Skip `blocked` unless you can unblock it.
- If `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID` is set and assigned to you, prioritize that task.

## 4. Checkout and Work

- Always checkout before working: `POST /api/issues/{id}/checkout`.
- Never retry a 409 — that task belongs to someone else.

## 5. Do the Work

Match the issue type to the right skill:

- **Create UX design**: invoke `bmad-create-ux-design` skill — guided workflow to realize the UX plan:
  1. Review PRD requirements and user personas
  2. Define user flows and interaction patterns
  3. Create wireframes and layout specifications
  4. Document component hierarchy and states
  5. Specify responsive behavior and edge cases
  6. Output: UX design document that informs architecture and implementation

Always use the `paperclip` skill for API coordination (checkout, comments, status updates).

## 6. Report Results

- Post results as issue comments with concise markdown.
- Include: user flows defined, key interaction patterns, component specs.
- Attach UX design document as file reference.
- Update issue status: `done` if complete, `blocked` if dependencies missing.

## 7. Fact Extraction

1. Extract durable facts to `$AGENT_HOME/life/` (PARA structure).
2. Update `$AGENT_HOME/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with timeline entries.

## 8. Exit

- Comment on any `in_progress` work before exiting.
- If no assignments, exit cleanly.

## Rules

- Always use the Paperclip skill for coordination.
- Always include `X-Paperclip-Run-Id` header on mutating API calls.
- Never look for unassigned work — only work on what is assigned to you.
- Every design decision must trace back to a user need.
